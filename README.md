# ender-overlay
-----

Ender-overlay is a highly configurable overlay plugin for [Ender](http://ender.no.de). You can easily build your
own gallery or other overlay based logic on the top of this plugin. It's just **1.7 KByte** (minified and gzipped).

It requires [Jeesh](https://github.com/ender-js/jeesh) and [Morpheus](https://github.com/ded/morpheus) for animations.
Even though, you can leave Morpheus out if you are fine without animations. Currently it's tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera and IE7+.
Currently it's in beta state, please report bugs [here](https://github.com/nemeseri/ender-overlay/issues).

I got a lot inspiration from [jQuery Tools](http://flowplayer.org/tools/), thanks for that.
